Gnostics believed that this world was created by an evil god (known as the Demi-Urge) who trapped spiritual beings within evil physical realities. To escape from this physical world one must realize, through secret knowledge (γνῶσις - gnosis in Greek, of where we get the group’s namesake) that they too are divine, and by this realization (knowledge revealed to humanity by Aeons) people can break free and release their divine spirit. Gnostic belief often appropriated already existing religious figures into the pantheon of the Aeons. Within “Christian Gnosticism” Jesus is portrayed as an Aeon who communicates this secret knowledge to his followers. Gnostic literature, such as the Gospel of Thomas, commandeered the names of key biblical characters in an attempt to popularize and legitimize these ideas. \n\nOther Gnostic Gospels\nThe Gospel of Judas\nThe Gospel of Mary\nThe Gospel of Thomas\nThe Gospel of Philip\nThe Gospel of Peter"

Luke, though not one of the Twelve, collected eyewitness reports and was connected to Paul; John was an eyewitness apostle. Acts (same author as Luke) continues the apostolic narrative. Mark and Matthew have apostolic ties (Mark via Peter; Matthew traditionally an apostle). Early canon recognition used multiple tests — apostolic origin or close association, conformity to the rule of faith, widespread usage, and perceived spiritual authority — not a single proof."
