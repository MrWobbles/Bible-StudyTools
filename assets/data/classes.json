Gnostics believed that this world was created by an evil god (known as the Demi-Urge) who trapped spiritual beings within evil physical realities. To escape from this physical world one must realize, through secret knowledge (γνῶσις - gnosis in Greek, of where we get the group’s namesake) that they too are divine, and by this realization (knowledge revealed to humanity by Aeons) people can break free and release their divine spirit. Gnostic belief often appropriated already existing religious figures into the pantheon of the Aeons. Within “Christian Gnosticism” Jesus is portrayed as an Aeon who communicates this secret knowledge to his followers. Gnostic literature, such as the Gospel of Thomas, commandeered the names of key biblical characters in an attempt to popularize and legitimize these ideas. \n\nOther Gnostic Gospels\nThe Gospel of Judas\nThe Gospel of Mary\nThe Gospel of Thomas\nThe Gospel of Philip\nThe Gospel of Peter"

            "There is a lot to this one, and not all of it is clear just reading through the scripture.  If you don't have a full understanding of context, not only Biblical, but cultural context of the time - then you're not going to have a satisfying rebuttal for this one.  Let's start with the idea that these were children, the Hebrew word that is used in place of 'youths' here has a fairly broad definition - most likely we can know that these youths that are referenced are older teenagers or men in their young 20's.  We see Joseph called naar at 17 years old in Genesis 37:2, Jeremiah when he was called into ministry in Jeremiah 1:6 and King Ahab defeated an army lead by 232 naarim in 1 Kings 20.  These are not likely small children but young adults - very much could have been a threat to Elisha, and in the comfort of our own church, I would go so far as to say that it is likely that violence was going to happen because of God's response - which isn't often as quick as it works in this instance. ",
            "Then, to go on further, the taunt wasn't purely about Elisha being bald - in that time, it was closer to calling someone effeminate, I won't use the more vulgar words - but I'm sure all or most of you know them and can substitute here.  Then when they were saying 'Go up' they were referencing and earlier event where Elijah - his teacher and mentor - had, in fact, gone up to heaven and left to be in the presence of God.  Which, not only are they saying they don't want him there, but that they are willing to help him go be with Elijah but they wouldn't have the means of God to get him there so I imagine they would resort to more violent methods. ",
            "If you are rebutting someone who is not Christian, stick to what the scripture says - don't editorialize, like I did for us here, but know the culture of the time, know the truth of Scripture and who it was written to - the Jewish people at the time would have understood all of this just by growing up where they did.",

The taunt 'Go up, you baldhead' was an aggressive, likely threatening insult (calling him effeminate and dismissing Elijah's ascent), and violence was plausible.

              "answer": "In Ephesians 6:10–18, the shield of faith protects us specifically against 'all the fiery darts of the wicked one'—not against hardship, discomfort, loss of reputation, or failed plans. The shield does not promise comfort or success; it allows us to withstand spiritual attacks and deception. When we apply Proverbs 30:5 correctly, we understand that God's purity and our trust in Him form a shield against spiritual lies and temptation."

              "answer": "Fiery darts are temptations, lies, accusations, and deceptions from Satan—attacks meant to make us doubt God's character, goodness, or the reliability of His Word. These are spiritual attacks, distinct from normal hardships like job loss, illness, or relational conflict. The shield protects our faith from being shaken by these deceptions."

              "prompt": "How do we often turn the shield in the wrong direction—to protect our identity?",
              "answer": "We turn the shield inward when we use our faith to defend our ego, reputation, or self-image rather than standing against deception about God. This happens when we become defensive about our beliefs instead of examining them, or when we reject truth that threatens our identity. A properly oriented shield faces outward toward the enemy's lies about God, not inward toward threats to our self-concept."

The warning reflects God's view of His Word as perfect and whole. Adding human ideas or traditions makes Scripture impure; removing hard sayings makes it incomplete. Careful observation and exact adherence honor God's authority and ensure we hear His actual message, not a distorted version."

This is not merely about adding or removing individual verses—it is about the grave spiritual danger of modifying God's truth. God takes the integrity and purity of His Word with ultimate seriousness."

For example, 'Jesus wept' (John 11:35) is accurate but meaningless without understanding the context of Lazarus's death and resurrection. Similarly, commands given to specific people in specific situations can be misapplied if torn from their context."

              "answer": "Most misuse of Scripture does not begin with rebellion; it begins with careless or selective reading (2 Peter 3:16). Untaught and unstable people twist Scripture to their own destruction. The Pharisees' misuse of the law (Matthew 15:1–9) shows how human tradition can obscure God's command. Proper context ensures we hear the whole counsel of God (Acts 20:25–31) rather than a partial or distorted version."
