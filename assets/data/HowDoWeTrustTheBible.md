How do we trust scripture?


1. What warning is repeated across these passages?


Pay attention to the language of adding, taking away, commands, words, and authority.


Proverbs 30:5–6 NKJV


Every word of God is pure;

He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.

Do not add to His words,

Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.

Every word of God is pure
The words that we have are correct and accurate, they are truth.  Too many times in our culture in order to tear down Scripture people will pull out verses, they will take them out of context and accuse God of being unloving, unjust, or contradictory - but anytime they do this, when we are properly prepared, we can put the verse back into context and show the purity of the word in all cases.  God’s Word is not  something that will break under pressure - God invites doubt and intense study because truth is not afraid of the light.  


Examples:


   Verse: Elisha and the Bears (2 Kings 2:23-25)


2 Kings 2:23–25 NKJV


Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”

So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.

Then he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.



Criticism: 
42 children were mauled by God just because they made fun of this prophet for being bald - that doesn't seem like a very forgiving thing to do, also the response is incredibly out of measure with the action.  There is no justice here, no mercy, no forgiveness - how can you say you serve a loving God when He does things like this?!

Response:
There is a lot to this one, and not all of it is clear just reading through the scripture.  If you don't have a full understanding of context, not only Biblical, but cultural context of the time - then you're not going to have a satisfying rebuttal for this one.  Let's start with the idea that these were children, the Hebrew word that is used in place of 'youths' here has a fairly broad definition - most likely we can know that these youths that are referenced are older teenagers or men in their young 20's.  We see Joseph called naar at 17 years old in Genesis 37:2, Jeremiah when he was called into ministry in Jeremiah 1:6 and King Ahab defeated an army lead by 232 naarim in 1 Kings 20.  These are not likely small children but young adults - very much could have been a threat to Elisha, and in the comfort of our own church, I would go so far as to say that it is likely that violence was going to happen because of God's response - which isn't often as quick as it works in this instance.

Then, to go on further, the taunt wasn't purely about Elisha being bald - in that time, it was closer to calling someone effeminate, I won't use the more vulgar words - but I'm sure all or most of you know them and can substitute here.  Then when they were saying 'Go up' they were referencing and earlier event where Elijah - his teacher and mentor - had, in fact, gone up to heaven and left to be in the presence of God.  Which, not only are they saying they don't want him there, but that they are willing to help him go be with Elijah but they wouldn't have the means of God to get him there so I imagine they would resort to more violent methods.

If you are rebutting someone who is not Christian, stick to what the scripture says - don't editorialize, like I did for us here, but know the culture of the time, know the truth of Scripture and who it was written to - the Jewish people at the time would have understood all of this just by growing up where they did.

Let's do another and then we will move on


Verse: Kill everyone in a city (Deuteronomy 20:16-17)


Deuteronomy 20:16–17 NKJV


“But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive, but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the Lord your God has commanded you, 


Criticism: 
God commanded the Israelites to “utterly destroy” every person living in the Canaanite cities God was giving them. They were instructed to “not leave alive anything that breathes”—to kill every man, woman, child, and animal (Deut. 20:16–17). Why would a good God have the Israelites exterminate entire groups of people, including women, children, and animals?

The word of God is pure - every instance of misunderstanding or contradiction or thinking God is not who He says He is, does not come from scriptural errors, but from our own ignorance.  When we come up to a challenging verse, we don't buckle under the pressure, we read and study and understand.


What is purity?  What do you guys know about Gold?


Zechariah 13:9 NKJV


I will bring the one-third through the fire,

Will refine them as silver is refined,

And test them as gold is tested.

They will call on My name,

And I will answer them.

I will say, ‘This is My people’;

And each one will say, ‘The Lord is my God.’ ”

How much contamination do we need before something is no longer pure?




Purity is proven under pressure, but it is revealed by exposure.


Psalm 119:105 NKJV


Your word is a lamp to my feet

And a light to my path.


John 3:20 NKJV


For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 


God is not practicing evil - His word is the light that we guide our lives by and if it were telling us to not look too closely then we would not be able to trust it.  God is love, God is light - His deeds are laid bare for all of us to see and criticize and study and get to know who He is and see that His nature stands up to scrutiny.

He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him
When we have a proper view of scripture and of who God is and our relationship with Him, He has promised us (and is faithful to keep His promises) that He will be a shield to us - to those of us who put our trust in Him.  What does that mean, though - to be a shield?  What does that look like in our lives?  How is it applied?


Ephesians 6:10–18 NKJV


Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints—


What is the whole armor of God for?  What does it protect us against?
What is the shield for? How does that inform our interpretation of Proverbs 30:5?


— Shield / fighting infographic & discussion —
     * What direction is the guy with the shield facing?  Why is that important?
     * What direction do we face with our shield?  Are we guarding against what God says it’s effsective for or are we trying to use it for our own purposes?

The shield does not promise us comfort, prevent hardship, guarantee success or protect our reputation (popularity) - it allows us to ‘quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one’.



One of the most common ways we turn the shield the wrong direction is by using it to protect who we believe ourselves to be.


Guarding our Identity Instead


Romans 12:1–2 NKJV


I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.


When Scripture confronts who you believe yourself to be, do you expect Scripture to change, or do you expect you to change?
What is the difference between studying to understand and studying to rationalize or excuse?


C — 


Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you and you be found a liar.
The consequences of having a poor view of scripture is our tendency to want to modify it.  And when we modify scripture we remove it’s purity - it’s perfectness from God.  Adding or removing from God’s word is sin, we start thinking - in our pride - we know better than God does.  That we have better advice, or we leave out something we disagree with so we change it.  God is clear what the consequences for sin are - biggest being death, seperation from Him, but there are also consequences for us while we are here on earth.


We fall into more and more sin, the snowball or the slippery slope effect, we start with a little lie and end up in adultery or murder - it may take months or years to get there, but ultimately it is on that path even if we can’t see it ourselves - God knows and He warns against it.

Romans 1:24–28 NKJV


Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves, who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, 1men with 1men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.

And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting;


Some of the natural consequences for our sin in this instance are laid out for us right here - we will be found a liar.  Now, we are so corrupted in this world that this doesn’t seem that big of a deal - I mean look at the type of people we elect to represent us on a national and global level.  Regardless of which side, if any, of the political aisle you are on you can identify liars.  So the consequences here seem so.. small - relatively, in our society today but let’s put a little more weight on it.


Taking away from God’s Word rarely looks like rejecting the Bible outright. More often, it looks like silence where Scripture speaks, or reinterpretation where Scripture is clear.


Acts 20:25–31 NKJV


“And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.


Which parts of Scripture are most often left out today? Why those parts?


To take away from God’s Word is still to lie, because it presents a partial truth as the whole truth.


John 8:44 NKJV


You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. 


What camp does this firmly put us in?  What does Jesus call Satan apart from a murderer?  Not an adulterer, not a revolutionary, does not call him out for his envy or jealousy - no, He calls the devil out for being a liar, and the father of lies and those who added to the word in order to ‘protect’ themselves are children of the devil - deceiving themselves and others to believe the lies that they setup, with the best of intentions, but ultimately disobeying the commandments of God.


Deuteronomy 12:32 NKJV


“Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.


Adding to God’s Word means placing additional requirements, boundaries, or interpretations on people that God Himself did not place.
Adding to God’s Word does not usually look like writing new verses. It looks like treating human wisdom, tradition, or preference as if it carries the same authority as Scripture.


Colossians 2:20–22 NKJV


Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations—“Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,” which all concern things which perish with the using—according to the commandments and doctrines of men? 


Because His commands are good - because they are truth, because they stand up to scrutiny - we should be careful to observe it.  If we are adding or taking away from it we are obstructing the purity of the word.  You can see this most evidently in the way the Pharisees and Sadducees had obstructed God’s Word in order to try and ‘protect’ themselves and others from breaking any commandments.  They had lifted the law up to be more important than the law giver.  In an effort to respect God their focus shifted from Him and onto what He told them to do. 

This is something we need to focus on - not that we shouldn’t follow God’s word but we, as humans - struggle with having a relationship with someone we cannot physically experience, and until you have a spiritual experience it’s difficult to understand what that relationship is like.  We can lose focus on the relationship with our savior and start focusing on what we can do while we are here - we focus on our work, our study, the rules, whatever it may be - God’s blessings would be a big one today, also looking for “signs and wonders” we need to be careful that we are not taking our focus off of God and putting it on what He has done or given to us.


Added rules feel protective because they create the illusion of control. They reduce faith to compliance, and compliance feels safer than trust because there are clear guidelines to follow. But Scripture says these rules have “an appearance of wisdom” while lacking power to restrain sin.


Revelation 22:18–19 NKJV


For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.


Context answers three questions Scripture never allows us to ignore:


Who is being addressed?
Why is this being said?
How does this fit with the rest of what God has already revealed?


A verse without context can be quoted accurately and still be applied falsely.


Most misuse of Scripture does not begin with rebellion, it begins with careless or selective reading.


2 Peter 3:16 NKJV


as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.





Matthew 15:1–9 NKJV


Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, “Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”

He answered and said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? For God commanded, saying, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’ But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God”—then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:

‘These people draw near to Me with their mouth,

And honor Me with their lips,

But their heart is far from Me.

And in vain they worship Me,

Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ”
