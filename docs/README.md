# Class 1 quick start

1) Set your video ID and pause times once in `config.js`.
2) Open `student.html` on the TV/second screen (cast or extend display).
3) Open `teacher.html` on your laptop; it sends commands to the display via BroadcastChannel/localStorage.
4) Use the buttons to play/pause, restart, jump to planned pauses, or fullscreen the display. Notes in the presenter view save locally to your laptop.
